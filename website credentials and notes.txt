The FRs I have implemented are in the URS, in the MoSCow table, properly enumerated as well.

1.If the EXE file for the forms does not open, it is because of a failing assembly reference
to the Business Logic or Data Access DLLs, I tried my best to fix it but the problem is from Visual Studio itself and may still persist.
Please consider using the Visual Studio IDE to run the forms project if this occurs.

2. The unit tests for the hashing run relatively slowly(approx. 350-500ms) compared to everything else, because the hash itself is designed to be slow
in order to prevent brute-force attacks, not because of a performance issue.
